These are the scripts I used to make the Deformation Lab. Procedural Generation and Mesh deformation Mechanics are all written by me. Other mechanics are all (Mostly) written by AI to save up some time (The focus here is the procedural generation and softbody physics) You can install the unity package and import it to your Unity editor to make some tweaks.
